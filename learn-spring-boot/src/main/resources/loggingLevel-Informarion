Logging levels are labels used to categorize the severity or urgency of each message logged by
an application. They allow administrators to distinguish messages that indicate normal functioning
from those that indicate potential issues and allow for dynamic control over log output volume.

Computer systems often utilize logging functions to record events within applications.
These logs conform to the Syslog standard, which defines facility codes and levels for each
logged event.

INFO-
    level messages are the most prevalent, highlighting events within a system that is crucial
    for its business purposes, such as starting or stopping services or resources being created,
    accessed, updated or deleted - these could include events such as service start/stop events
    as well as updates/deletes etc.
ERROR-
    level messages are similar to INFO-level events, but their purpose is different -
    they represent situations which prevent an application from performing its usual
    operations normally. While work can continue normally despite this occurrence,
    its source should be investigated immediately.
WARN-
    level messages are less frequent but still represent error conditions that prevent an
    application from functioning as it should. Although the application still functions,
    its existence should prompt developers or operations personnel to attend to it immediately.
Critical-
    level messages are much rarer and indicate a severe problem that cannot continue operating
    normally. While the application can continue functioning normally, their presence should
    prompt dev, ops and support teams to take immediate action in response.
FATAL-
    level messages are rare and intended to indicate an error event so serious it will preclude
    an application from operating normally. Although an application can continue functioning
    normally during such an incident, its occurrence should be investigated immediately to
    keep operations running smoothly.
